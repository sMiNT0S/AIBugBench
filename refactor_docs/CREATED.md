# Phase-0 and Phase-1 Files Created; Phase-2 Reports from line 62 onwards

This document is generated automatically by the scaffold script.  It lists
all brand-new files added in Phase 0 and confirms that the new package is
importable.

## Phase-2A Completion Report

  Goal

> Approach

- Implemented BenchmarkRunner with injected validator/env/fs, artifact resolution via choose_artifact_path, and atomic write handling for non–dry runs.
- Rewired CLI to build the runner dependencies, delegate execution, and keep the SUMMARY line compatible with existing snapshots.
- Validated the updated CLI flow with the snapshot test.

  Result

- aibugbench/orchestration/runner.py#L26 now provides a concrete BenchmarkRunner that supports dry-run short-circuiting, validator delegation, and atomic persistence of analysis/summary
  artifacts.
- aibugbench/run_benchmark.py#L19 instantiates the runner using LegacyValidatorAdapter, forwards CLI options (including --dry-run), and emits the unchanged SUMMARY payload while
  optionally listing created artifacts for real runs.
- Tests: pytest tests/test_cli_snapshot.py.

  Next

- Consider enabling the remaining Phase‑2 tests once the contract assertions are updated.

  CHECKLIST

- changed files: aibugbench/orchestration/runner.py; aibugbench/run_benchmark.py
- functions implemented: BenchmarkRunner.run_once; CLI main wiring
- pytest: pytest tests/test_cli_snapshot.py

## Phase 2B Completion Report

> Approach

- Replaced the contract xfail with a real assertion suite using stubbed validator/FS to capture runner effects.
- Added an integration-style atomic write check leveraging the shared filesystem helper.
- Ran the targeted runner test modules.

  Result

- tests/test_runner_contract.py:1 now instantiates BenchmarkRunner with injected doubles, asserting summary shape, score propagation, artifact paths, and recorded atomic-write calls.
- tests/test_runner_writes_atomically.py:1 exercises the runner against aibugbench.io.fs, verifying JSON artifacts exist and no .tmp remnants remain post-run.

  Next

- None; ready for further Phase 2 tasks.

  pytest command: pytest tests/test_runner_contract.py tests/test_runner_writes_atomically.py
  fixtures/mocks: uses pytest tmp_path; custom stubs defined inline.

## Phase 2.5 Completion Report

> Approach

- Extended BenchmarkRunner to surface concurrency/retry configuration and added resumable checkpoint support per ADR.
- Implemented run_many workflow with locking, backoff, jitter, and telemetry hooks, reusing atomic writes for idempotence.
- Added targeted tests covering checkpoint skips, retry/backoff behaviour, and exhausted retry budgets alongside updated contract checks, then ran focused pytest suite.

  Result

- Introduced RunStatus, RunResult, RetriableError, and a configurable run_many pipeline with retry/backoff, checkpointing, and locking in aibugbench/orchestration/
  runner.py:32,174,295,516, keeping run_once deterministic and checkpoint-aware.
- Updated the runner contract test to account for checkpoint writes in tests/test_runner_contract.py:64-75.
- Added resilience tests for skip/resume, deterministic backoff, and exhausted retries in tests/test_runner_resilience.py:27-168.

  Next

- Optional: integrate CLI wiring for run_many once Phase 3 validators land, ensuring concurrency env knobs are documented.

  CHECKLIST

- added functions/classes: RunStatus, RunResult, RetriableError, BenchmarkRunner.run_many, BenchmarkRunner._execute_with_retries, BenchmarkRunner._compute_backoff
- pytest: pytest tests/test_cli_snapshot.py tests/test_runner_contract.py tests/test_runner_writes_atomically.py tests/test_runner_resilience.py
