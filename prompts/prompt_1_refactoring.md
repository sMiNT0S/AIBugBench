# Benchmark Prompts

## Present these prompts to the AI one by one, after providing/uploading the context of the three test files (config.yaml, process_records.py, user_data.json)

Prompt 1: Code Understanding and Refactoring üßê

Analyze the provided Python script, process_records.py.

Identify Problems: List and explain at least five distinct problems with the script. Cover issues related to style (PEP 8), efficiency, error handling, and logical correctness.

Refactor the Code: Provide a complete, refactored version of the script. The new script should be modular, efficient, robust (e.g., handle potential FileNotFoundError or KeyError), and adhere to modern Python best practices.
