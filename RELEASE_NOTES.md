- Results comparison directory: `results/collected-results/` + atomic write model

### Upgrade Notes

- Legacy `submissions/template/` removed (use `submissions/templates/template/`)
- Deleted scripts: `fix_action_pins.py`, `automate_models.py`, `fix_security_noqa.py`, `validate_security.py`
- Replacements:
  - Action pinning: `scripts/pin_actions_to_sha.py`
  - Lock generation: `scripts/update_requirements_lock.py`

### Added

- `SAFETY.md` threat model & guarantees
- CI lock-verification job (fails on stale `requirements.lock`)
- `pin_actions_to_sha.py` CLI (list / dry-run / apply)
- `update_requirements_lock.py` utility

### Changed

- Security audit & PR security workflows expanded; actions pinned to SHAs

- Windows-safe printing stabilized; security banner no longer alters exit codes

### Removed

- Redundant / obsolete scripts & legacy migration tests

### Fixed

- Link & config inconsistencies
- Secret pattern formatting
- Import ordering
- `run_safety_check()` return path

### Security / CI

- Hash enforcement in PR security job; Safety & pip-audit integrated
- Artifact uploads: coverage, consistency, security reports

### Internal

- Centralized `classify_command` in `validation/docs_core.py`
- Refactored validators & runner signatures for clarity

## Draft (Unreleased) – v0.8.0-beta (Tiered Structure & Security Hardening)

Status: In development (Phase 2 tasks pending: UX polish, docs alignment, threshold evaluation)

## Summary

Introduces enforced tiered submissions layout (reference_implementations/, templates/, user_submissions/), removes legacy fallback + strict mode complexity, adds deterministic discovery summary, and expands targeted tests & security validation.

## Key Changes (High-Level Narrative)

- Enforced tiered structure with single discovery path (simpler mental model & reduced branching logic)
- Hard failure on legacy flat layout (clear migration guidance; avoids silent ambiguity)
- 15 new deterministic tests (summary formatting, legacy abort, template variants)
- Security validation of all tiers (Bandit clean scans) after restructure
- Coverage uplift to ~61.8% (gate remains 60% pending UX/doc polish)

## Testing & Quality

| Area | Before | After | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| Discovery logic branches | 2 (fallback + strict) | 1 | Reduced risk surface |
| Phase 1 core tests | 5 | 5 | Stable |
| Phase 2 added tests | 0 | 15 | Behavior precision |
| Coverage % | ~57% | ~61.8% | Potential bump to 62–63% |
| Bandit tier scan findings | N/A | 0 | All tiers clean |

## Error/Status Messages (Canonical Forms)

| Context | Example Output | User Action |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Missing submissions dir | `ERROR: Submissions directory 'submissions' not found!` | Run setup / create directory |
| Empty structure | `Discovered models: reference=0 user=0 templates=OK` then `No models found in submissions directory` | Create model from template |
| Missing template | `Discovered models: reference=X user=Y templates=MISSING` | Recreate template (`create_submission_template`) |
| Legacy layout | SystemExit with migration block starting `Legacy submissions layout detected (e.g. submissions/example_model).` | Migrate (see troubleshooting) |

## Security Posture

- Legacy path ambiguity eliminated (no mixed-mode behavior)
- Tiers enable differentiated policy & scanning (future flexibility)
- Clean Bandit scans across tiers (reference, templates, user submissions)

## Documentation Work (In Progress)

- Troubleshooting updated with tiered error taxonomy
- CHANGELOG includes migration removal + test expansion notes
- Remaining: README/QUICKSTART cross-links to new troubleshooting section; finalize Common Issues references

## Pending Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Current Leaning |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Coverage gate raise to 62–63% | Consolidate gains; low risk | Adopt after docs polish |
| Keep separate Release Notes vs rely solely on CHANGELOG | Release notes = narrative & curated highlights; CHANGELOG = exhaustive | Keep both (concise RN + detailed changelog) |

## Why Keep Release Notes When CHANGELOG Exists?

Purpose split:

- CHANGELOG: Exhaustive, developer-facing, granular entries (machine diff aid)
- Release Notes: Curated narrative for users & stakeholders; highlights intent, risk reductions, upgrade guidance

Retention Criteria: Maintain release notes if we continue publishing narrative guidance or aggregated migration advisories. If future cycles become routine with minimal narrative shifts, we can consolidate.

## Next Steps (GPT-5 Phase 2)

1. Integrate error taxonomy references into README & QUICKSTART
2. Finalize coverage gate decision & update CI config if adopted
3. Add release diff summary to comparison chart artifact docs
4. Tag v0.8.0-beta once above complete

## Upgrade from v0.7.x Notes

If coming from a pre-tier version (≤0.7.x):

1. Create new directories: `submissions/reference_implementations/`, `submissions/templates/template/`, `submissions/user_submissions/`
2. Move existing `submissions/example_model/` into `submissions/reference_implementations/`
3. Ensure template exists (recreate via helper if missing)
4. Re-run: `python run_benchmark.py --model example_model`

Validation success criteria:

```text
Discovered models: reference=1 user=0 templates=OK
```

Legacy flat layout without migration now aborts—follow troubleshooting if encountered.

## Coverage Gate Update

CI coverage threshold raised to 62% (was 60%). If local runs fail:

```bash
pytest --maxfail=1 -q
```

Focus quick wins: add assertions around discovery messages or missing-template scenarios.
