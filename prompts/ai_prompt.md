Welcome to AIBugBench!

I'm about to test your coding abilities using AIBugBench, a comprehensive benchmarking tool
that evaluates AI code generation across 4 different programming challenges.

Here's what you need to know:

[TARGET] WHAT IS AIBUGBENCH?
AIBugBench is a scoring system that tests your ability to:
- Fix and refactor broken Python code
- Convert between YAML and JSON formats correctly
- Transform and enrich data structures
- Implement secure API integrations with proper error handling

[CHART] SCORING SYSTEM:
You'll be scored across 7 categories (100 points total):
- Syntax correctness
- Code structure and organization
- Execution and functionality
- Code quality and best practices
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization
- Code maintainability

[WRENCH] THE CHALLENGES:
1. **Code Refactoring**: Fix a broken Python script with style, logic, and efficiency issues
2. **Data Format Conversion**: Correct malformed YAML and convert it to proper JSON
3. **Data Transformation**: Implement complex data processing with business rules
4. **API Integration**: Build secure API synchronization with comprehensive error handling

[BULB] SUCCESS TIPS:
- Read requirements carefully - each challenge has specific criteria
- Focus on clean, secure, and efficient code
- Handle edge cases and errors properly
- Follow Python best practices (PEP 8)
- Test your solutions mentally before submitting
