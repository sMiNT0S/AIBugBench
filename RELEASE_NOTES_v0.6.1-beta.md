# 🚀 AIBugBench v0.6.1-beta Release Notes

**Release Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Repository**: [AIBugBench](https://github.com/sMiNT0S/AIBugBench)  
**Previous Version**: v0.6.0 → v0.6.1-beta  
**Status**: 🔶 **Pre-Release Beta** - Feature-complete but not production-ready

---

## 📋 Release Overview

This **beta release** represents a **massive documentation transformation** focused on eliminating barriers to entry and creating a seamless first-time user experience. Through systematic fresh user testing, we identified and resolved critical usability issues that were preventing successful adoption of the benchmark.

> **Note**: This is a pre-1.0.0 beta release. While the core functionality is stable and well-tested, the project is still evolving toward production readiness. Expect continued improvements and potential breaking changes before v1.0.0.

**Key Achievement**: Complete transition from confusing 8-step setup to streamlined **3-part, 15-minute user journey** with cross-platform compatibility.
