Concise links to internal operational READMEs not previously surfaced in site navigation.

> These are advanced / maintenance oriented resources. For normal usage start with the standard guides in the nav.

## Validation Package

Location: `validation/`

Purpose: Internal modules for documentation command extraction, security checks, and repo audit.

Key README: [validation/README.md](../validation/README.md)

## Documentation Validation Script

Location: `scripts/validate_docs.py`

Purpose: Parses all Markdown docs, classifies commands by safety, and optionally executes them crossâ€‘platform to ensure documentation accuracy.

Key README: [scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md)

## Model Submissions Workflow

Location: `submissions/`

Purpose: Holds model solution directories (reference, templates, user submissions) used by the benchmark runner.

Guide: [submissions/README.md](../submissions/README.md)  
Template Instructions: [submissions/templates/template/README.md](../submissions/templates/template/README.md)

## Repository Audit Tool

Location: Root `repo_audit_enhanced.py` (also wrapped in `validation/`)

Purpose: Offline readiness scoring (documentation, testing, security, CI, reproducibility).

Usage Examples: See validation README section.

## Suggested Maintenance Flow

1. Run `python scripts/validate_docs.py --json` before releases.
2. Run `python validation/repo_audit_enhanced.py --strict --min-score 85` to enforce baseline health.
3. Use security validation helpers (`scripts/validate_security.py` if present) to confirm scanning setup.
